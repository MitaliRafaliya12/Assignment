    "#QUS1 What is an Exception in python? Write the different between Exception and syntax error.\n",
    "#Ans: \n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.\n",
    "It's an error that occurs at runtime and can be handled using exception handling mechanism in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a division by zero error, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or trying to use an undefined variable can all raise exceptions. \n",
    "The Python Standard Library provides many built-in exceptions that you can catch and handle in your code to handle various errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the code violates the grammar rules of the programming language,\n",
    "such as incorrect indentation or missing colons. These errors are usually caught at the time the code is parsed and compiled, rather than at runtime.\n",
    "Because syntax errors stop the code from being executed, they need to be fixed before the code can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be handled in your code, while syntax errors are compile-time errors that need to be fixed \n",
    "before your code can run."
