    "A database is a software system used for storing and managing data. It is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way to allow for efficient access, retrieval, and modification of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases with different approaches to storing and managing data. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them. SQL databases use SQL, a standardized language, to interact with the data and manipulate it. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are based on non-relational models, and they store data in more flexible ways. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data and provide horizontal scalability. NoSQL databases use non-standardized APIs to interact with the data and manipulate it. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB."

It is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that each row is unique and can be easily accessed by other tables that reference it. A primary key cannot contain null values and must be unique across all rows in the table. Typically, a primary key is created using an integer column with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute.\n",

    "                A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity. A foreign key can have multiple values that correspond to the values of the primary key in another table. By using foreign keys, we can create relationships between tables, which allows us to query data across multiple tables.\n",
