    "\n",
    "There are several modes in which you can open a file in Python:\n",

    "'r' (read-only mode): This is the default mode when you open a file in Python. In this mode, you can only read the contents of the file, and you cannot make any changes to it. If the file does not exist, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): In this mode, you can write to the file. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): In this mode, you can write to the end of the file. If the file already exists, the new data will be appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (exclusive creation mode): In this mode, a new file is created for writing, but an error will be raised if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (binary mode): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or a video. When you open a binary file in binary mode, the contents of the file will be read and written as bytes."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "#ANS:\n",
    "        In Python, the close function is used to close a file that has been opened. Closing a file is important because it frees up system resources that were used by the file and ensures that the file is properly saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, Python creates a file object that is stored in memory. This file object contains information about the file, including its contents, position, and status. The file object also keeps a reference to the operating system's file descriptor, which is a low-level representation of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done working with a file, you should close it to release the file object and its associated resources. This is especially important if you're working with large files, because a file that is left open can consume a significant amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any changes you've made to the file are properly saved to disk. When you write to a file, the changes are usually stored in a buffer in memory and not immediately written to disk. Closing the file forces any remaining data in the buffer to be written to disk, ensuring that your changes are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the with statement to automatically close a file, even if an exception is raised. The with statement takes care of closing the file for you, so you don't have to worry about it"
