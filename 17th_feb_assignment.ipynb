    "Question 1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a JSON-like document format to store and retrieve data. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it ideal for use in modern web applications and other scenarios that require high levels of scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database that do not rely on the traditional relational data model used by SQL databases. Instead, they are designed to handle semi-structured and unstructured data, such as documents, graphs, and key-value pairs. Non-relational databases are highly scalable and can be used in distributed environments, making them well-suited for use in cloud-based applications and other scenarios where data needs to be highly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios in which MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to store data in a way that is more closely aligned with the data structures used by modern applications, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where the data being stored is complex or constantly changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "High scalability: MongoDB's distributed architecture makes it highly scalable, allowing it to handle large volumes of data across multiple nodes and clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides several features, such as automatic failover and replica sets, which can help ensure high levels of availability for applications that require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast queries: MongoDB supports a variety of query languages, including its own query language and SQL-like syntax, which allows developers to quickly and easily retrieve data from the database."

    "Question 2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a variety of features that make it well-suited for modern web applications and other scenarios that require high levels of scalability, performance, and flexibility. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data model: MongoDB's document-based data model allows developers to store data in a more flexible and natural way, making it well-suited for scenarios where data structures may be complex or constantly evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides a variety of indexing options, including single field, compound, and multi-key indexes, which can improve query performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework allows developers to perform complex data analysis tasks on large datasets using a variety of pipeline stages and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication and sharding: MongoDB's distributed architecture provides built-in support for replication and sharding, which can help ensure high levels of availability, scalability, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic failover: MongoDB provides automatic failover capabilities that can help ensure high levels of availability and reliability for applications that require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB's GridFS feature provides a way to store and retrieve large files, such as images and videos, that exceed the maximum document size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB supports a variety of query languages, including its own query language and SQL-like syntax, which allows developers to quickly and easily retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community support: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers and users, which provides access to a wealth of resources and expertise."
